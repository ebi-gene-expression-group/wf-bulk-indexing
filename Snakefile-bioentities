# - species: the species to be processed
# - ens_eg_version: E! or E! Genomes version
# - wbsp_version: Wormbase version. Note that some species use both E! and Wormbase.
# - output_dir: For outputs, this is where the JSONL will be left
# - target: currently either "load" or "jsonl". The second one stops there and doesn't execute

# - atlas_exps: Usually the directory where the $ATLAS_EXPS experiments are.
# - atlas_exp_design: Path to where the experiment designs file have been copied (from wwwdev)
# - atlas_env_file: Path to a file with environment variables to set Zookeeper, Solr, and Postgres.
# - bioentities_source: Path to the source bioentities folder (results of E! Update live here)
